# **Health Tracker with Reminders for Seniors**
Authors: Lasha Kaliashvili, Mikheil Uglava.

## **Goal of the Project**
The main goal of the project was to create a purpose-built program designed to enhance the overall health management experience for the elderly population by providing tools to make it easier to manage and keep track of health-related scheduled activities, such as medications and doctor appointments.

#### Objectives of the Project:
* Develop an intuitive user interface: create a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of seniors. We built the program with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of navigation.
* Enable users to sign up and log in to their accounts: a user can easily sign up with their information (email, username, password, etc.) and then log in with their personal credentials to their account to access their personal experience of the program.
* Provide tools to store basic information about users: When you first open an account of the health tracker, you will be asked to enter your information, such as name, age, date of birth, etc. so that the elderly can take this information with them anywhere they go with easy access.
* Provide tools to track medications: users can track their upcoming medications (medication name, when to take it, etc.), and they can add new ones, as well as delete existing ones from the database.
* Provide tools to track doctor appointments: the same goes for doctor appointments - users can track their upcoming appointments (doctor name, last name, appointment date, and time), add new ones, and delete existing ones.
* Integrate reminder functionality: integrate a reminder system that sends timely notifications to the user's email address for scheduled medications and upcoming doctor appointments.

## **Significance of the Project**
The Health Tracker with Reminders for Seniors can hold immense significance in enhancing the lives of the elderly by addressing specific challenges they face in managing their health.
* Many seniors deal with complex medication regimens and multiple doctor appointments. Our Health Tracker simplifies these processes, reducing the cognitive burden on seniors and promoting a more organized and efficient approach to health management.
* Forgetfulness is a normal part of aging. As people grow older, changes occur in all parts of the body, including the brain [1]. As a result, many people don't remember information as well as they once did and aren't able to recall it as quickly. By providing timely reminders for medications and appointments via email, the program helps seniors stay on track with their healthcare routines, reducing the likelihood of missed medications and appointments.
* Often, family members and caregivers play a crucial role in the well-being of seniors. This program can also be extremely useful to them - providing the same benefits to receive reminders and updates to them as well.
* And finally, the Health Tracker actively promotes the independence of seniors by providing a platform that allows them to take charge of their well-being while fostering a sense of control over their health-related activities.
